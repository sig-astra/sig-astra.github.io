*SIGASTRA.INFO* is a site all about tech advice and resources
from Sig.

This includes
	-Software and Site Recommendations
	-Tech-Related Reading Materials
	-A For-Answers-to-Questions Page

In addition, there is an "Admin" page meant to help Sig access the host server,
so that he can actively improve the site on the go.




"Home"

This is the home page with some background information.


"Admin"

Due to security reasons, this page only includes an external link
to the website used by Sig to access the [future] site server remotely,
which requires a login.
*Once the site is on its own server, this page will contain more
features and tools, but it will be locked.


"Recommended Software/Links"

This page has a list of websites where to get software that has been
tested and recommended by Sig.
*Reviews of software are to be added soon.


"Materials/PDFs"

This page grants access to tech-related materials, including chapters
from the CompTIA A+ book.


"FAQs"

This is a comprehensive question-answer page brought to you by Microsoft.
Ask it any question you can think of and it will find you an answer. Somewhere.
